# On Efficiently Representing Regular Languages as RNNs

Code accompanying the ACL 2024 publication "On Efficiently Representing Regular Languages as RNNs".

### Getting started with the code
Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:rycolab/bpdas.git
$ cd bpdas
```
It may be beneficial to create a new Python virtual environment (e.g., using conda). 
We aim at Python 3.10 version and above.

You can then install the package in editable mode:
```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

We use pytest to unit test the code.
You can run the tests with:
```bash
$ pytest tests/
```
